  <p>What's good l8r g8r!</p>
  <p>Thank you so much for playing with the l8r b8a. We're glad to have you on board.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:nsbarr@gmail.com">contact Nick</a>.</p>
  <p>Latest version: 0.6</p>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>If you're having issues l8ring, delete and restart the app. I changed the data model. If that doesn't work, lmk.</li>
	  	<li>Tap to l8r! It's now super-duper easy to l8r anything. l8rs come back to you at the right time. Sounds scary, I know. But chill and believe in the system. l8r'ing is now as chill as the concept "later" is.</li>
      <li>Some dope new artwork by the talented and awesome Eunsan.</li>
	  	<li>Longpress to "super-l8r." l8r to a place, a date, or a person. Only l8ring to a date works right now -- want to help me build the rest?</li>
	  	<li>All l8rs are (still) local. Your secrets are safe with you.</li>
