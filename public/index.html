</span>Hi there! I'm a product builder based in Brooklyn and the Bay Area.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm working with <a href="http://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> to imagine new tools that support teachers and classrooms.</p>
            <p>On the Internet, you can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/nsbarr">Twitter</a> & <a href="https://medium.com/@nsbarr">Medium</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>New interfaces for expression</h2>

            <p>I like giving people new ways to express themselves.</p>
            <p>In 2015, I helped launch <a href="http://tapslash.com">Slash</a>, a custom keyboard for iOS that makes it easy to find & share links without switching apps. </p>
            <p>Slash was named <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@GoldenKittyMeow/collections/tech-products-of-the-year">Tech Product of the Year</a> by the Product Hunt community.<figure>
        <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Promo video for <em>Slash Keyboard</em></span>
        <div class="video-container">
        <iframe class="video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/147668435?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
      </figure></p>
            <p>I've prototyped some simple creativity apps.</p>
            <p>First there's <a href="http://appstore.com/todayatextadventureinspace">Today</a>, in which the player navigates a word through space, colliding into new words to form a sentence. 
            <figure>
        <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Snippet of <em>Today, a Text Adventure in Space</em></span>
        <img src="images/today-crop.gif">
      </figure></p>
            <p><label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  <img src="images/jonasdemo.gif" style="max-width:200px;">
</span>Next up I built the <a href="http://appstore.com/theprisonerskeyboard">Prisoner's Keyboard</a>, which lets people construct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram">lipograms</a> by removing letters from their iOS keyboard.</p>
            <p>And then there's <a href="http://appstore.com/masterpass">MasterPass</a>, an original game that combines gameplay elements from Hangman with Mastermind.</p>
            <p>My most recent side project is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jonas/id1109447355?ls=1&mt=8">Jonas</a>, a creative storytelling + drawing app.</p>
            <p>Way back in 2013, I helped start DrawQuest, which encouraged the habit of creativity with daily drawing challenges. The community grew to +1MM Questers. After the business shut down we <a href="https://github.com/drawquest/drawquest">open-sourced</a> the project.

        <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The <em>DrawQuest</em> Editor, designed by the wonderful Shaun Pendergast</span>

      <h2>Growing networks</h2>
      <p>My very 1st startup gig was with Ning, a platform for creating your own social network for anything.</p>
      <p>At Ning I learned about the <a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf">strength of weak ties</a>, & I continue to look for ways to bring people together.</p>
      <p>In 2014, I worked with Quire, a betaworks-founded platform that enables people to become co-owners of the companies they love.<figure>
        <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Some of the companies that have raised capital on <em>Quire</em></span>
        <img src="images/quire.png">
      </figure></p>
      <p>I also help other companies solve product challenges and figure out how to grow their own networks. I've mentored at organizations like Coalition for Queens, Orbital, Startup Institute, and Techstars.</p>
      <h2>Contact me</h2>
      <p>If you think there's an opportunity for us to work together, I'd love to hear from you! My email address is nsbarr@gmail.com.</p><p>I'm also always happy to talk about things other than work, like experimental poetry, mushroom hunting, or the depth of the Yankees' bullpen.
