        <h1>Nick Barr</h1>
        <section id="bio">
            <p>Hi there! I'm a product builder based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
            <p>I focus on products that help people be creative, productive, & more connected.</p>
            <p>Currently, I split my time between collaborations, personal projects, & client work.</p>
            <p>Organizations where I've mentored &/or given talks include: Coalition for Queens, Future of Web Design, Internet Week New York, Orbital, Startup Institute, & Techstars.</p>
            <p>I'm <b>@nsbarr</b> on Twitter, Medium, & others. To get in touch, email me at nsbarr@gmail.com.</p>
            <h2>New interfaces for expression</h2>
            <p>I enjoy helping people express themselves in new ways. I think the QWERTY keyboard is a particularly boring & entrenched way to create text.</p>
            <p>In 2015, I helped launch <a href="http://tapslash.com">Slash</a>, a custom keyboard for iOS that makes it easy to find & share links without switching apps. Tapping "/" unlocks features like Spotify, Giphy, Contacts, YouTube, & more. Slash helps people maximize "<a href="https://medium.com/slash-keyboard/ideas-per-minute-the-metric-that-matters-9c4bbab47ad6">ideas per minute</a> by supporting the rapid communication of ideas in all their forms.</p>
            <p>Previously, in 2014, I built <a href="http://appstore.com/todayatextadventureinspace">Today</a>, in which the player navigates a word through space, colliding into new words to form a sentence. Later that year I built the <a href="http://appstore.com/theprisonerskeyboard">Prisoner's Keyboard</a>, which lets people construct lipograms by removing letters from the keyboard.</p>
            <h2>Do work</h2>
            <p>The word "productivity" has become painfully unhip. But productivity is just a symptom of a particular mental state, what Csikszentmihalyi calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in reclaiming productivity by building products that help people engage in life more deeply with fewer distractions. A current project, <a href="https://medium.com/the-l8r-log">l8r</a>, introduces a new, lightweight way to jot down & revisit ideas.</p>
            <h2>Creativity as habit</h2>
            <p>In 2011 I joined Canvas Networks, where we built Canvas - a community for sharing & remixing images. Through Canvas, we learned a lot about creativity: that many people think of themselves as talentless; that some think they have don't have time; that the blank page can be terrifying. We took what we learned & built DrawQuest, <label for="mn-dq" class="margin-toggle"></label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><img src="images/03_editor.png">DrawQuest</span>, which encouraged the habit of creativity with daily drawing challenges. The community grew to +1MM Questers. After the business shut down we <a href="https://github.com/drawquest/drawquest">open-sourced</a> the project.</p>
