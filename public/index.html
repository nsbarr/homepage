            <h2>New interfaces for expression</h2>

            <p>I like giving people new ways to express themselves.</p>
            <p>In 2015, I helped launch <a href="http://tapslash.com">Slash</a>, a custom keyboard for iOS that makes it easy to find & share links without switching apps. Slash was named <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@GoldenKittyMeow/collections/tech-products-of-the-year">Tech Product of the Year</a> by the Product Hunt community.<figure>

        <div class="video-container">
        <iframe class="video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/147668435?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
      </figure></p>
            <p>In 2014, I learned to code by building a few wordplay apps for iOS.</p>
            <p>First there was <a href="http://appstore.com/todayatextadventureinspace">Today</a>, in which the player navigates a word through space, colliding into new words to form a sentence.

      </figure></p>
            <p>Next up I built the <a href="http://appstore.com/theprisonerskeyboard">Prisoner's Keyboard</a>, which lets people construct lipograms by removing letters from their iOS keyboard.</p>
            <p>My most recent side project is <a href="http://appstore.com/masterpass">MasterPass</a>, an original game that combines gameplay elements from Hangman with Mastermind.</p>
            <p>In 2013, I helped start DrawQuest, which encouraged the habit of creativity with daily drawing challenges. The community grew to +1MM Questers. After the business shut down we <a href="https://github.com/drawquest/drawquest">open-sourced</a> the project.

      <h2>Growing networks</h2>
      <p>My first gig out of school was at Ning, a platform for creating your own social network for anything.</p>
      <p>At Ning I learned about the <a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf">strength of weak ties</a>, and I continue to look for ways to brink people together.</p>
      <p>In 2014, I helped start Quire, which lets people become co-owners of the companies they love.<figure>

            <h2>Let's do something cool together</h2>
            <p>I've held senior product roles at Slash, betaworks, Canvas Networks, & Ning.</p> 
            <p>I've mentored &/or given talks at Coalition for Queens, Future of Web Design, Internet Week New York, Orbital, Startup Institute, & Techstars.</p>
