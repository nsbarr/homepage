        <section id="bio">
            <p>Hi there! I'm a product builder based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
            <p>I enjoy helping people express themselves in new ways.</p>
            
            <h2>New interfaces for expression</h2>
            
            <p>In 2015, I helped launch <a href="http://tapslash.com">Slash</a>, a custom keyboard for iOS that makes it easy to find & share links without switching apps. Slash was named <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@GoldenKittyMeow/collections/tech-products-of-the-year">Tech Product of the Year</a> by the Product Hunt community.</p>
            <p>In 2014, I learned to code by building a few wordplay apps for iOS.</p>
            <p>First there was <a href="http://appstore.com/todayatextadventureinspace">Today</a>, in which the player navigates a word through space, colliding into new words to form a sentence.

        <label for="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-exports-imports" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Snippet of <em>Today, a Text Adventure in Space</em></span>

      </figure></p>
            <p>Next up I built the <a href="http://appstore.com/theprisonerskeyboard">Prisoner's Keyboard</a>, which lets people construct lipograms by removing letters from their iOS keyboard.</p>
            <p>My most recent side project is <a href="appstore.com/masterpass">MasterPass</a>, an original game that combines gameplay elements from Hangman with Mastermind.</p>
            <p>Way back in 2011, I helped build DrawQuest, which encouraged the habit of creativity with daily drawing challenges. The community grew to +1MM Questers. After the business shut down we <a href="https://github.com/drawquest/drawquest">open-sourced</a> the project.</p>

            <h2>Let's do something cool together</h2>
            <p>I've held senior product roles at Slash, betaworks, Canvas Networks, & Ning.</p> 
            <p>I've mentored &/or given talks at Coalition for Queens, Future of Web Design, Internet Week New York, Orbital, Startup Institute, & Techstars.</p>
            <p>Currently, I split my time between collaborations, personal projects, & client work.</p>
            <p> I'm <b>@nsbarr</b> on Twitter, Medium, & others. To get in touch, email me at nsbarr@gmail.com.</p>
