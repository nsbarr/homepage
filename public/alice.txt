me: pipe a song about a lamb so i piped with merry cheer piper pipe that song again so i piped: he wept to hear drop thy pipe thy happy pipe sing thy songs of happy cheer: so i sang the same again while he wept with joy to hear piper sit thee down and write in a book that all may read so he vanishd from my sight and i pluckd a hollow reed and i made a rural pen and i staind the water clear and i wrote my happy songs every child may joy to hear the shepherd how sweet is the shepherds sweet lot from the morn to the evening he stays he shall follow his sheep all the day and his tongue shall be

english child but i am black as if bereaved of light my mother taught me underneath a tree and sitting down before the heat of today she took me on her lap and kissed me and pointed to the east began to say: look on the rising sun: there god does live and gives his light and gives his heat away and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive comfort in morning joy in the noonday and we are put on earth a little space that we may learn to bear the beams of love and these black bodies and this sunburnt face is but a cloud and like a shady grove for when our souls have learnd the heat to bear the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice saying come out from the grove my love and care and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice thus did today my mother say and kissed me and thus i say to

thousands of sweepers dick joe ned and jack were all of them locked up in coffins of black and by came an angel who had a bright key and he opened the coffins and let them all free then down a green plain leaping laughing they run and wash in a river and shine in the sun then naked and white all their bags left behind they rise upon clouds and sport in the wind and the angel told tom if hed be a good boy hed have god for his father and never want joy and so tom awoke and we rose in the dark and got with our bags and our brushes to work though the morning was cold tom was happy and warm: so if

as snow till into the high dome of pauls they like thames waters flow oh what a multitude they seemed these flowers of london town seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own the hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands now like a mighty wild they raise to heaven the voice of song or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among: beneath them sit the aged man wise guardians of the poor then cherish pity lest you drive an angel from your door night the sun descending in the west the evening star does shine the birds are silent in their nest and i must seek for mine the moon like a flower in heavens high bower with silent delight sits and smiles on the night farewell green fields and happy grove where flocks have taen delight where lambs have nibbled silent move the feet of angels bright unseen they pour blessing and joy without ceasing on each bud and blossom and each sleeping bosom they look in every thoughtless nest where birds are covered warm they visit caves of every beast to keep them all from harm: if they see any weeping that should have been sleeping they pour sleep on their head and sit down by their bed when wolves and tigers howl for prey they pitying stand and weep seeking to drive their thirst away and keep them from the sheep but if they rush dreadful the angels most heedful receive each mild spirit new worlds to inherit and there the lions ruddy eyes shall flow with tears of gold: and pitying the tender cries and walking round the fold: saying: wrath by his meekness and by his health sickness are driven away from our immortal day and now beside thee bleating lamb i can lie down and sleep or think on him who bore thy name graze after

heartbroke i heard her say: oh my children do they cry do they hear their father sigh now they look abroad to see now return and weep for me pitying i dropped a tear: but i saw a glowworm near who

and fruitful land babes reduced to misery fed with cold and usurous hand is that trembling cry a song can it be a song of joy and so many children poor it is a land of poverty and their son does never shine and their fields are bleak and bare and their ways are filled with thorns: it is eternal winter there for whereer the sun does shine and whereer the rain does fall babes should never hunger there nor poverty the mind appall the little girl lost in futurity i prophetic see that the earth from sleep (grave the sentence deep) shall arise and seek for her maker meek and the desert wild become a garden mild in the southern clime where the summers prime never fades away lovely lyca lay seven summers old lovely lyca told she had wandered long hearing wild birds song sweet sleep come to me underneath this tree do father mother weep where can lyca sleep lost in desert wild is your little child how can lyca sleep if her mother weep if her heart does ache then let lyca wake if my mother sleep lyca shall not weep frowning frowning night oer this desert bright let thy moon arise while i close my eyes sleeping lyca lay while the beasts of prey come from caverns deep viewed the maid asleep the kingly lion stood and the virgin viewed: then he gambolled round oer the hallowed ground leopards tigers play round her as she lay while the lion old bowed his mane of gold and her breast did lick and upon her neck from his eyes of flame ruby tears there came while the lioness loosed her slender dress and naked they conveyed to caves the sleeping maid the little girl found all the night in woe lycas parents go over valleys deep while the deserts weep tired and woebegone hoarse with making moan arm in arm seven days they traced the desert ways seven nights they sleep among shadows deep and dream they see their child starved in desert wild pale through pathless ways the fancied image strays famished weeping weak with hollow piteous shriek rising from unrest the trembling woman presse with feet of weary woe she could no further go in his arms he bore her armed with sorrow sore till before their way a couching lion lay turning back was vain: soon his heavy mane bore them to the ground then he stalked around smelling to his prey but their fears allay when he licks their hands and silent by them stands they look upon his eyes filled with deep surprise and wondering behold a spirit armed in gold on his head a crown on his shoulders down flowed today his golden hair gone was all their care follow me he said weep not for the maid in my palace deep lyca lies asleep then they followed where the vision led and saw their sleeping child among tigers wild to this day they dwell in a lonely dell nor fear the wolvish howl nor the lions growl the chimney sweeper a little black thing in the snow crying weep weep in notes of woe where are thy father and mother say they are both gone up to the church to pray because i was happy upon the heath and smiled among the winters snow they clothed me in the clothes of death and taught me to sing the notes of woe and because i am happy and dance and sing they think they have done me no injury and are gone to praise god and his priest and king who make up a heaven of our misery nurses song when voices of children are heard on the green and whisperings are in the dale the days of my youth rise fresh in my mind my face turns green and pale then come home my children the sun is gone down and the dews of night arise your spring and your day are wasted in play and your winter and night in disguise the sick rose o rose thou art sick the invisible worm that flies in the night in the howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy and his dark secret love does thy life destroy the fly little fly thy summers play my thoughtless hand has brushed away am not i a fly like thee or art not thou a man like me for i dance and drink and sing till some blind hand shall brush my wing if thought is life and strength and breath and the want of thought is death then am i a happy fly if i live or if i die the angel i dreamt a dream what can it mean and that i was a maiden queen guarded by an angel mild: witless woe was neer beguiled and i wept both night and day and he wiped my tears away and i wept both day and night and hid from him my hearts delight so he took his wings and fled then the morn blushed rosy red i dried my tears and armed my fears with tenthousand shields and spears soon my angel came again i was armed he came in vain for the time of youth was fled and grey hairs were on my head the tiger tiger tiger burning bright in the forest of the night what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry in what distant deeps or skies burnt the fire of thine eyes on what wings dare he aspire what the hand dare seize the fire and what shoulder and what art could twist the sinews of thy heart and when thy heart began to beat what dread hand and what dread feet what the hammer what the chain in what furnace was thy brain what the anvil what dread grasp dare its deadly terrors clasp when the stars threw down their spears and watered heaven with their tears did he smile his work to see did he who made the lamb make thee tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night what immortal hand or eye dare frame thy fearful symmetry my pretty rose tree a flower was offered to me such a flower as may never bore but i said ive a pretty rose tree and i passed the sweet flower oer then i went to my pretty rose tree to tend her by day and by night but my rose turned away with jealousy and her thorns were my only delight ah sunflower ah sunflower weary of time who countest the steps of the sun seeking after that sweet golden clime where the travellers journey is done where the youth pined away with desire and the pale virgin shrouded in snow arise from their graves and aspire where my sunflower wishes to go the lily the modest rose puts forth a thorn the humble sheep a threatning horn: while the lily white shall in love delight nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright the garden of love i laid me down upon a bank where love lay sleeping i heard among the rushes dank weeping weeping then i went to the heath and the wild to the thistles and thorns of the waste and they told me how they were beguiled driven out and compelled to the chaste i went to the garden of love and saw what i never had seen a chapel was built in the midst where i used to play on the green and the gates of this chapel were shut and thou shalt not writ over the door so i turned to the garden of love that so many sweet flowers bore and i saw it was filled with graves and tombstones where flowers should be and priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys and desires the little vagabond dear mother dear mother the church is cold but the alehouse is healthy and pleasant and warm besides i can tell where i am used well the poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell but if at the church they would give us some ale and a pleasant fire our souls to regale wed sing and wed pray all the livelong day nor ever once wish from the church to stray then the parson might preach and drink and sing and wed be as happy as birds in the spring and modest dame lurch who is always at church would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch and god like a father rejoicing to see his children as pleasant and happy as he would have no more quarrel with the devil or the barrel but kiss him and give him both drink and apparel london i wandered through each chartered street near where the chartered thames does flow a mark in every face i meet marks of weakness marks of woe in every cry of every man in every infants cry of fear in every voice in every ban the mindforged manacles i hear: how the chimneysweepers cry every blackening church appals and the hapless soldiers sigh runs in blood down palacewalls but most through midnight streets i hear how the youthful harlots curse blasts the newborn infants tear and blights with plagues the marriagehearse the human abstract pity would be no more if we did not make somebody poor and mercy no more could be if all were as happy as we and mutual fear brings peace till the selfish loves increase then cruelty knits a snare and spreads his baits with care he sits down with his holy fears and waters the ground with tears then humility takes its root underneath his foot soon spreads the dismal shade of mystery over his head and the caterpillar and fly feed on the mystery and it bears the fruit of deceit ruddy and sweet to eat and the raven his nest has made in its thickest shade the gods of the earth and sea sought through nature to find this tree but their search was all in vain: there grows one in the human brain infant sorrow my mother groaned my father wept: into the dangerous world i leapt helpless naked piping loud like a fiend hid in a cloud struggling in my fathers hands striving against my swaddlingbands bound and weary i thought best to sulk upon my mothers breast a poison tree i was angry with my friend: i told my wrath my wrath did end i was angry with my foe: i told it not my wrath did grow and i watered it in fears night and morning with my tears and i sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles and it grew both day and night till it bore an apple bright and my foe beheld it shine and he knew that it was mine and into my garden stole when the night had veiled the pole in the morning glad i see my foe outstretched beneath the tree a little boy lost nought loves another as itself nor venerates another so nor is it possible to thought a greater than itself to know and father how can i love you or any of my brothers more i love you like the little bird that picks up crumbs around the door the priest sat by and heard the child in trembling zeal he seized his hair he led him by his little coat and all admired the priestly care and standing on the altar high lo what a fiend is here said he: one who sets reason up for judge of our most holy mystery the weeping child could not be heard the weeping parents wept in vain: they stripped him to his little shirt and bound him in an iron chain and burned him in a holy place where many had been burned before the weeping parents wept in vain are such thing done on albions shore a little girl lost children of the future age reading this indignant page know that in a former time love sweet love was thought a crime in the age of gold free from winters cold youth and maiden bright to the holy light naked in the sunny beams delight once a youthful pair filled with softest care met in garden bright where the holy light had just removed the curtains of the night then in rising day on the grass they play parents were afar strangers came not near and the maiden soon forgot her fear tired with kisses sweet they agree to meet when the silent sleep waves oer heavens deep and the weary tired wanderers weep to her father white came the maiden bright but his loving look like the holy book all her tender limbs with terror shook ona pale and weak to thy father speak oh the trembling fear oh the dismal care that shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair the schoolboy i love to rise on a summer morn when birds are singing on every tree the distant huntsman winds his horn and the skylark sings with me: oh what sweet company but to go to school in a summer morn oh it drives all joy away under a cruel eye outworn the little ones spend the day in sighing and dismay ah then at times i drooping sit and spend many an anxious hour nor in my book can i take delight nor sit in learnings bower worn through with the dreary shower how can the bird that is born for joy sit in a cage and sing how can a child when fears annoy but droop his tender wing and forget his youthful spring oh father and mother if buds are nipped and blossoms blown away and if the tender plants are stripped of their joy in the springing day by sorrow and cares dismay how shall the summer arise in joy or the summer fruits appear or how shall we gather what griefs destroy or bless the mellowing year when the blasts of winter appear to terzah whateer is born of mortal birth must be consumed with the earth to rise from generation free: then what have i to do with thee the sexes sprang from shame and pride blown in the morn in evening died but mercy changed death into sleep the sexes rose to work and weep thou mother of my mortal part with cruelty didst mould my heart and with false selfdeceiving tears didst bind my nostrils eyes and ears didst close my tongue in senseless clay and me to mortal life betray the death of jesus set me free: then what have i to do with thee the voice of the ancient bard youth of delight come hither and see the opening morn image of truth newborn doubt is fled and clouds of reason dark disputes and artful teazing folly is an endless maze tangled roots perplex her ways how many have fallen there they stumble all night over bones of the dead and feel they know not what but care and wish to lead others when they should be ledappendix a divine image
